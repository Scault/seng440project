Goal: 

- minimize the number of operations
- implement the table of powers method rather than mongomery multiplication
    - requires many tables to implement
- use 16-bit integers
- M is a 16-bit integer
- try to estimate how many tables you need, how much memory you need, etc.
- how many cache misses are we going to encounter? (hint: LOTS)
- try to include many software optimization techniques (eg. pipelining, etc.)
- define a new instruction to activate a hardware assist which stores all tables of powers
- compare all software solution with the hardware-based solution
- keep an eye on cache misses; too many cache misses -> try software pipelining
